## General Steps

1. What is it and why do we need it
2. Requirements/Goals of the System  
    1. Functional Requirements  
    2. Non-Functional Requirements  
    3. Extended Requirements
3. Capacity Estimations  
    1. Storage Estimations  
    2. Traffic Estimations  
    3. Bandwidth Estimations
    4. Memory Estimations  
4. System APIs
5. Database Design
6. High Level System Design
    * Explain Different Components of the System
7. Cache/ Load Balancing/ Data Partioning


## Simplify Storage Estimations
